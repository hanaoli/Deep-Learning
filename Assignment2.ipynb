    "\n",
    "1. You can use whatever CNN architecture, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet. However, you must build the networks layer by layer. You must NOT import the archetectures from ```keras.applications``` or other pretrained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure ```BatchNormalization``` is between a ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer and an ```activation``` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you want to regularize a ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer, you should place a ```Dropout``` layer **before** the ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer.\n",
    "4. You should obtain at least 80% accuracy on testing dataset.\n",
    "5. You do not have to follow the following procedure, you can always write your own code and functions. But make sure the code is bug-free.\n",
